        <p>Hi everyone! Currently I am undecided with my major. Some of my hobbies are running, playing guitar and piano, and I love going to the beach since I live in California. 
            I am not married and I do not have any children. Currently I do not have a job but over the summer I worked as a nanny and I also worked part time as an administrative assistant at an Optometrist. 
         </p>
         <p>The thing that I love most about BYU-Idaho is that I get to meet so many new people and most of the people here share the same standards as me. 
            I am taking this web design course because I thought it would be cool to know how to build a website and I thought it would be fun. I can use this is my life if I decided to pursue a career in web design.
            </p>
        <p>I grew up going to chruch so I have been a member for a long time. 
            One of my favorite quotes about the gospel is from Sister Becky Craven. She says "Living the gospel comes through a million small, but faithful decisions and then the courage to follow the Spirit to live by those decisions".
